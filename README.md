# Range-Only Localization System for Small-Scale Flapping-Wing Robots

The design of localization systems for small-scale flapping-wing aerial robots faces relevant challenges caused by the limited payload and onboard computational resources. This paper presents an ultra-wideband localization system particularly designed for small-scale flapping-wing robots. The solution relies on custom 5 grams ultra-wideband sensors and provides robust, very efficient (in terms of both computation and energy consumption), and accurate (mean error of 0.28 meters) 3D position estimation. We validate our system using a Flapper Nimble+ flapping-wing robot.
